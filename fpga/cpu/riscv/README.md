# RISC-V Core

Github: http://github.com/ultraembedded/riscv

A 32-bit RISC-V core written in Verilog and an instruction set simulator supporting RV32IM.  
This core has been tested against a co-simulation model, exercised on FPGA, and is capable of booting a modified version of the Linux kernel.

## Core

The core (riscv_core) contains;
* RV32I, RV32IM, or RV32IM+Supervisor/User Mode/MMU support depending on core variant.
* 5-stage in-order, single issue.
* Modified Harvard architecture.
* Custom bus interfaces which can be connected directly to either RAM or Instruction / Data cache.

## Example Core Instance (with TCM memory)

The top (top_tcm_axi/src_v/riscv_tcm_top.v) contains;
* Instances one of the above cores, adding RAM and standard bus interfaces.
* 64KB dual ported RAM for (I/D code and data).
* AXI4 slave port for loading the RAM, DMA access, etc (including support for burst access).
* AXI4-Lite master port for CPU access to peripherals.
* Separate reset for CPU core to dual ported RAM / AXI interface (to allow program code to be loaded prior to CPU reset de-assertion).
